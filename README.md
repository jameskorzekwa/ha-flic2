# **Flic Bluetooth for Home Assistant**

![Flic logo](custom_components/flic_ble/brand/icon.png)

Connect supported Flic buttons directly to Home Assistant through its native
Bluetooth integration, including ESPHome Bluetooth proxies. No Flic Hub or
`flicd` daemon is required.

> **Use Home Assistant as your Flic hub.** This integration completely replaces
> the Flic Hub for every button paired with it. It is not a bridge to a Flic Hub,
> and the hub does not participate after migration.

## Home Assistant replaces the Flic Hub

Buttons are paired directly with Home Assistant, which owns their encrypted
Bluetooth connections and turns their presses and gestures into Home Assistant
events. Existing Flic Hub assignments, modules, and automations are not
migrated.

Before moving a button to Home Assistant:

1. Remove it from every Flic Hub or other controller that currently owns it.
2. Put it into public pairing mode.
3. Pair it with **Flic Bluetooth** in Home Assistant.
4. Recreate the button's actions as Home Assistant automations.

A button cannot remain paired with a Flic Hub and Home Assistant at the same
time. Once migrated, the Flic Hub and its modules will no longer receive events
from that button.

## Supported hardware

- Flic v2 round buttons
- Flic Duo
- Big- and small-button events on Flic Duo
- Single, double, hold, and four-direction swipe events

Legacy Flic v1 buttons are not supported. Flic v1 uses a different,
undocumented protocol and cloud-assisted pairing mechanism. Flic has sold v2
hardware for years, but older round buttons may still be v1.

## Features

- Direct encrypted pairing with Home Assistant
- Local operation without a Flic Hub or cloud service
- ESPHome Bluetooth proxy routing and failover
- Persistent BLE sessions for reliable, low-latency events
- Battery voltage reporting
- Swipe recognition without duplicate click events
- Hold recognition without a duplicate click on release

Flic Duo push-twist, fall detection, firmware updates, and HID/MIDI
configuration are not currently supported.

## Installation with HACS

This integration is intended to be installed from a tagged GitHub release
through HACS.

Until it is included in the default HACS repository list:

1. In HACS, open **Integrations**.
2. Open the menu and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/jameskorzekwa/ha-flic-ble` as an **Integration**.
4. Install **Flic Bluetooth** and restart Home Assistant.

The Home Assistant integration domain is `flic_ble`.

## Build a strong Bluetooth network first

Reliable Flic operation depends on reliable, continuous Bluetooth coverage at
every button. A single Bluetooth adapter beside the Home Assistant server may
be enough for a small space, but it is usually not enough for a larger,
multi-floor, or RF-challenging home. Set up a distributed Bluetooth network
before pairing buttons that are far from the server.

The recommended approach is to place ESPHome Bluetooth proxies around the home
and let Home Assistant route each Flic connection through the best available
proxy:

- [Set up an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy/)
- [Home Assistant Bluetooth proxy documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies)

Place proxies close enough to the buttons for a strong signal, keep their Wi-Fi
or Ethernet connection reliable, and configure enough active connection slots
for the nearby buttons. Each connected Flic uses one active BLE connection
slot.

The proxy nearest each button must support active BLE connections:

```yaml
bluetooth_proxy:
  active: true
  connection_slots: 3
```

Increase the number of slots or distribute buttons across additional proxies
when supporting more buttons than a nearby proxy can hold.

## Pairing

1. Confirm that the target button has been removed from every Flic Hub or other
   controller. Pairing will fail while another controller still owns it.
2. Hold the button for at least six seconds to enter public pairing mode.
3. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration**.
4. Select **Flic Bluetooth** and follow the pairing flow.

## Events

Each button creates a Home Assistant Event entity.

Round Flic buttons and the Flic Duo big button emit:

- `single`
- `double`
- `hold`
- `swipe_left`, `swipe_right`, `swipe_up`, and `swipe_down` on Flic Duo

The Flic Duo small button uses the `small_` prefix, such as `small_single`,
`small_hold`, and `small_swipe_left`.

Event data includes the physical button, gesture, event counter, button
timestamp, queue status, and Duo acceleration vector when available.
